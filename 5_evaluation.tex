\section{Evaluation and Results}
\label{sec:evaluation-and-results}

We seek to evaluate whether \textsc{Appjudicator} is able to successfully
achieve its goal of distinguishing user-initiated network flows using UI
context, and whether it can do so with acceptable overhead. To determine whether
the app accomplishes its goal we perform a practical analysis and to measure the
app's resource cost we perform a performance evaluation. We now explain the
procedures used for each of these experiments and their results.

\subsection{Differentiating User-generated Flows}
\label{sec:differentiating-user-generated-flows}

The goal of this experiment is to determine whether \textsc{Appjudicator} can
successfully distinguish between network flows that were specifically initiated
by a human user and flows generated automatically by an app or the Android
system.

\subsubsection{Experimental Setup}
\label{sec:experimental-setup}

% Use UI Automator to simulate real clicks, also find other apps that make background requests automatically
% Log whether each flow was user-generated, default-allowed, or automated
% What percentage of those flows were classified successfully?
