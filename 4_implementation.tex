\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:implementation}

\textsc{Appjudicator} is a complex application with disparate components that
must run simultaneously and communicate with each other properly. The app can be
broadly broken down into three main components: the accessibility service, which
implements Android's \texttt{AccessibilityService}
API~\cite{googledevelopers2020}; the local VPN server, which implements
Android's \texttt{VpnService} API~\cite{googledevelopers2020vpn}; and the
host-based SDN agent, which implements a subset of the OpenFlow 1.0
standard~\cite{mckeown2008}.

The app is implemented using Kotlin, an object-oriented programming language
that is interoperable with Java and compiles to Java Virtual Machine bytecode.
This is Google's preferred language for Android development, and makes some
tasks like null-checking and concurrency easier than they would be in
Java~\cite{lardinois2019}.

\subsection{Accessibility Service}
\label{sec:implementation-accessibility-service}

Android's \texttt{AccessibilityService} API is designed for applications for
individuals with additional need for tools like screen readers and automated UI
navigators. By registering an accessibility service with the operating system,
we can be notified of changes in the UI state of other applications. These
changes are referred to as accessibility events, and are asynchronously
triggered by the Android operating system and delivered to the listening
accessibility service.

% TODO include details about the process of registering an accessibility service
% in code

\subsubsection{Accessibility Events}
\label{sec:accessibility-events}

An accessibility event represents a single state change in the user interface of
an app, such as a button being clicked, a view being swiped, or the focus
changing~\cite{accessibilityserviceguide}. An accessibility service can specify
the particular app packages and event types it wants to receive, but
\textsc{Appjudicator} registers for all all event types from all packages.

The accessibility event object contains some context about the UI interaction,
including the type of UI element, the type of interaction (\textit{e.g.} click,
swipe, long press), and descriptive text of the
element~\cite{accessibilityserviceguide}. Additional information about the UI
element that initiated the event can be retrieved with the
\texttt{AccessibilityEvent.getSource()} method. This method allows the app to
get information about the layout hierarchy, providing context about the
element's enclosing views and child elements. Because this context information
could potentially expose private user data the service must declare the
\texttt{canRetrieveWindowContent} attribute in its configuration XML file. With
this attribute set, Android will warn the user that the application can retrieve
the contents of the screen when it is enabled.

By default, the operating system only includes view objects it thinks are
important to accessibility with the accessibility event, but we can request
information about all views instead by passing the 
\texttt{FLAG\_INCLUDE\_NOT\_IMPORTANT\_VIEWS} flag to the accessibility
service~\cite{accessibilityserviceguide}.

These accessibility events are fired for almost every type of UI interaction,
including clicks, swipes, long presses, and even input from devices like virtual
or physical keyboard. However, events fired from apps that do not use Android's
UI libraries do not provide as much context. For example, we cannot get layout
hierarchy information from an app that renders its UI in OpenGL or some other
graphics platform~\cite{accessibilityserviceguide}.
%TODO get citation on this, maybe say that these types of events are rare

% TODO include an example of an accessibility event and layout hierarchy as a
% diagram or text. Show layout XML and the info we get side-by-side.

\subsubsection{Asynchronous Event Handling}
\label{sec:asynchronous-event-handling}

When an accessibility event is generated, the Android operating system passes
the generated object to the accessibility service's
\texttt{onAccessibilityEvent()} callback
asynchronously~\cite{googledevelopers2020}. The event handler does not block the
user interface because it runs on a different thread, which helps achieve the
our goal of adding minimal latency. However, this asynchronous processing also
means an app may continue generating accessibility events while an earlier event
is still being processed, so we must make sure to handle events efficiently.

\subsubsection{Identifying UI Elements}
\label{sec:identifying-ui-elements}

Accessibility events do not provide a unique identifier for UI elements, so we
implement a system inspired by Fazzini~\etal \cite{fazzini2017}. Android UI
elements, called views, may have an ID, but these are not guaranteed to be
unique or even present on every view. We use the initiating element's resource
ID and resort to a selector based on the element's position in the XML UI tree
if the ID is missing or non-unique. This allows us to precisely correlate a
network flow with the particular UI interaction that initiated it. These
selectors should also be relatively stable across multiple application launches
because they will not change as long as the app's UI structure remains constant.
Developers rarely make large structural changes to app interfaces because they
go against common human-computer interaction guidelines~\cite{norman2013}.

% TODO include an example.

\subsubsection{Permissions and Security}
\label{sec:accessibility-permissions}

\textsc{Appjudicator} declares a service that requests the
\texttt{BIND\_ACCESSIBILITY\_SERVICE} permission in the Android manifest file.
This declaration tells Android which class represents the service, and also
specifies another XML configuration file.  The file provides metadata about the
service, such as listing which types of accessibility events to subscribe to,
and providing a description of the service's purpose to be shown to the user
when it is enabled.

For security reasons an app cannot enable its own accessibility
service~\cite{kalysch2018}. To prevent malware from taking advantage of the
far-reaching permissions of accessibility services, a user must manually enable
the service in the system settings after being prompted with a dialogue box that
explains some of the risks involved. \textsc{Appjudicator} can only point the
user toward the settings page, the rest must be done manually. A user may have
any number of accessibility services running at a time, but they must be
individually manually enabled and each display a persistent notification
reminding the user that the service is still running in the background.

% TODO include screenshot of permissions warning

\subsection{VPN Service}
\label{sec:implementation-vpn-service}

In order to capture network context, we connect to a VPN server running locally
on the device using Android's \texttt{VpnService} API. We register a new VPN
connection using this API and prompt the user to connect to it. This routes all
the device's traffic through our service, which captures and logs packets before
forwarding them along to their destination.

The VPN service provides a \texttt{ParcelFileDescriptor} instance that can be
used to read and write packets from the interface's buffer~\cite{vpnguide}.
Normally, a VPN service would forward packets through a tunnel to a remote VPN
server, but \textsc{Appjudicator}'s VPN server runs locally on the device.
Packets are instead passed to processes running on other threads that log the
packets and forward them along to their destination.

% TODO write about how there's no encryption/decryption (get a citation)

\subsubsection{Deconstructing Flows}
\label{sec:deconstructing-flows}

Captured packets are parsed, logged, and reconstructed by the VPN service using
Pcap4J, a third-party Java IP packet library~\cite{kaito2016}. Source and
destination IP addresses are collected from the packet's IP header, along with
source and destination ports from the TCP or UDP header. \textsc{Appjudicator}
currently only supports IPv4, so any intercepted IPv6 packets are simply
dropped. Likewise, packets with unknown transport-layer protocols
(\textit{i.e.}, neither TCP nor UDP) are dropped.

% TODO explain how to link flows to PIDs and queue packets in a flow once I
% figure out how to do that

Packets are stored in a hash map indexed by the concatenation of source address,
source port, destination address, destination port, and protocol (either TCP or
UDP). Sequences of packets with identical values for each of these fields are
considered to be part of the same network flow. This system makes it easy to
look up all the packets belonging to a particular flow.

\subsubsection{Multithreading}
\label{sec:multithreading}

Network connections are performance-critical, so we need to ensure that the user
experience is not blocked waiting for \textsc{Appjudicator} to process network
requests. All network processing is performed off of the main thread using
Kotlin's concurrency framework. This allows the VPN service to have a minimal
impact on performance.

\subsubsection{Permissions and Security}
\label{sec:vpn-permissions}

For the VPN service to work, \textsc{Appjudicator} must request the
\texttt{INTERNET} permission and declare a service that requests the
\texttt{BIND\_VPN\_SERVICE} permission in the Android manifest. It must also
name a route to capture traffic from. We use \texttt{0.0.0.0/0} to capture all
IPv4 traffic, but this could be changed so the VPN is only used on traffic of a
particular interface or subnet.

After the app is installed, the VPN service can be started or stopped directly
from it. \textsc{Appjudicator} provides simple buttons to do this, or it can be
configured to connect to the VPN automatically on startup. The service can also
be stopped or disabled from Android's settings menu for security reasons.

% TODO add section about configuring the VPN. i.e. we always allow TCP traffic to
% the controller. The controller IP and port have to be inputted manually.

\subsection{Host-Based SDN}
\label{sec:host-based-sdn}

\textsc{Appjudicator} is designed to integrate with corporate SDN
infrastructure, so it needs to be able to communicate with an SDN controller
server. The OpenFlow switch specification, the de facto standard for
software-defined networking, describes a protocol for switch-controller
communication~\cite{openflowspec}. This specification is designed for large
network switches connected to potentially dozens of hosts, so implementing it on
a smartphone in Kotlin requires some special considerations.\footnote{See
Sections \ref{sec:software-defined-networking} and
\ref{sec:the-android-phone-as-an-sdn-agent} for a discussion of prior work in
host-based SDN agents on Android and other platforms.}

Large portions of the OpenFlow switch specification simply do not apply to
\textsc{Appjudicator}. For example, the app has no concept of Ethernet frames
and only one ``physical port'' in the sense that it is a switch for only one
host.

% TODO talk about potentially connecting to multiple controllers in the future

\subsubsection{SDN Rule Cache}
\label{sec:implementation-sdn-rule-cache}

\textsc{Appjudicator} implements a subset of the OpenFlow standard as a
host-based SDN agent. It acts in conjunction with a central SDN controller
server, and caches packet-forwarding rules from the server on the device. If a
particular network flow seems suspicious, or the SDN agent does not have a rule
for it, the entire packet can be elevated to the controller along with
contextual information such as details about any recent UI interactions as part
of a ``packet in'' message. \textsc{Appjudicator} will continue forwarding,
blocking, or elevating packets in other flows while waiting for a response from
the SDN controller. The controller makes a decision based on the network and UI
context and sends back a ``packet out'' response describing what to do with the
flow.

\subsubsection{OpenFlow Protocol}
\label{sec:openflow-protocol}

The OpenFlow Switch Specification describes a protocol for SDN agents to connect
to a controller and exchange messages. \textsc{Appjudicator} implements the
minimum allowable subset of this specification. All OpenFlow messages are sent
over TCP in OpenFlow packets. These packets have a simple 8-byte header that
describes the OpenFlow version, the type of the message, the total length of the
packet, and transaction ID (see Figure~\ref{fig:openflow-header}). Replies to an
OpenFlow message have the same transaction ID as the request.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{openflow-header.png}
    \caption{Fields of an OpenFlow packet header.}
    \label{fig:openflow-header}
\end{figure}

When the app is launched it opens a new TCP connection to a user-configurable IP
address or host name that runs the controller server. The controller and switch
each send a message of type \texttt{OFPT\_HELLO} to initiate the connection. The
controller then queries the switch to see what capabilities and features it
supports with a \texttt{OFPT\_FEATURES\_REQUEST}.  \textsc{Appjudicator} replies
with a message explaining that it has one physical port (the phone itself) and
only supports two packet actions: forward and drop.  At this point the
connection is fully established, and the controller and agent can both send
messages back and forth. Figure~\ref{fig:openflow-handshake} shows this process.

% TODO talk about how we only support a subset of normal flow table entries

	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{openflow-handshake.png}
    \caption{OpenFlow handshake diagram.}
    \label{fig:openflow-handshake}
\end{wrapfigure}

% TODO add more about switch-initiated messages (packet-in and packet-out)

\subsubsection{Associating Network Flows with Context}
\label{sec:associating-network-flows-with-context}

\textit{[Details of this section may change.]}

When the SDN agent intercepts a new flow to a previously unknown domain, it
tries to associate it with UI context. The app looks up any accessibility events
that occurred in the two seconds before the flow was initiated. If there is no
likely initiator of the network flow (such as a button press) within the two
prior seconds the flow is considered non-user-initiated. The SDN agent includes
information about these UI events, including the event type and view hierarchy
(see Section~\ref{sec:identifying-ui-elements}) with the packet as it is
elevated to the controller. This UI context should allow for more powerful and
fine-grained SDN rules.

% TODO add more info here, stuff about getting PIDs

\subsubsection{Default-Allow Flows}
\label{sec:default-allow-flows}

Our system must account for non-user-initiated flows that occur as part of the
normal operation of the device. To do this, we profile the Android operating
system and common applications in advance.  While running in calibration mode,
\textsc{Appjudicator} adds the IP address and ports of all non-user-initiated
requests to a default-allow map. Then later, while operating normally, the app
will not question flows to these pairs of IP address and ports even if they are
not user-initiated.

% TODO what to do when controller is unavailable
